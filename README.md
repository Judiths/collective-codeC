Some C code is reoriganized

1. There are two main sample sorting C code. Although it can give your right result, there'are some problems exist. For example, the samplSort_multiThread.c programming has a big latency because of the code "sleep()". To implement the synchronization among threads, I used the "mutex" method, but I couldn't give a better performance... If you have a better implementation based on my code, please commit me. Thanks a lot!
